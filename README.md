# Quiz-App

It is a quiz app application. There are different cards in the application and these cards are "Start Quiz", "Quiz Questions" and "Quiz Score" cards that appear when the quiz is over. When "start quiz" is clicked on the Start Quiz card, the card disappears and the questions are displayed dynamically.

On the questions card that appears on the screen, the question, the options that change colors when hovered, the number of questions you are in, and the time allotted for the question are displayed. When any of the options is clicked, the time stops, it is seen whether there is a correct or wrong answer, the button appears to go to the next question, and any other option cannot be clicked. If no option is clicked within the specified time, the correct option and the "next question" button will appear directly.

After the test is over, the card showing the score comes. This card dynamically shows how many of the questions were answered correctly. There are also "Restart" and "Finish Test" buttons on this card. When the restart button is clicked, the test starts again from the first question. When the end of the test button is clicked, the "Start Quiz" screen appears.
